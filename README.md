# Weather App [React]

This project was created to train my React/Redux/Typescript skills.
Also this project is an alias to my previous project named Weather App ( you can find it on my github [repository](https://github.com/ybogdanq/WeatherApp) or by clicking this direct [link](https://ybogdanq.github.io/WeatherApp/) )

`You should check up more pretty good projects from my `[portfolio](<(https://ybogdanq.github.io/BusinessCard/)>).


## Setting up project
`To set up project you have to:`
1. Download all files from DEV branch in my repository.

2. Run `"npm i"` in terminal to install all dependecies.

3. Start the dev server by running `"npm run start"` to see all changes and to see UI of the project.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm run stylelint`

Runs the style linting of css/scss code (But actually this command breaks up some scss code in case that I had to setup more dependencies, but I didn't). You can still run up this command, but `I HAVE TO WARN YOU THAT YOU SHOULDN'T DO THIS`.

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.
